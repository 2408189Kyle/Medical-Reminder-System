# Medical-Reminder-System

# Description / Overview
The Medical Reminder System is a Java console-based application designed to help users
manage their medicines and ensure they take them on time. It allows users to add, view, update,
and delete medicine records, including scheduled reminder times. The system uses
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and a scheduling mechanism to trigger console
notifications at specified times. It solves the problem of forgetting medication by providing daily
reminders and organized record-keeping in a simple and efficient way.
